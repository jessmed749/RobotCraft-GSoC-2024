# Robot Craft: Rebuild the Future

## Introduction

Welcome to **Robot Craft**, an exciting educational adventure set in a future where the city of Tunaria has been left in ruins by a conflict between cats and robocats. This game, developed as part of Google's Summer of Code (GSoC) using Pocket Code, aims to introduce children to fundamental coding concepts through an engaging and interactive experience. Join Whiskers and his friends as they embark on a mission to restore their city and learn essential coding skills along the way!

## Objectives

- **Teach Basic Coding Concepts:** Introduce young learners to programming fundamentals such as variables, loops, sequences, and functions.
- **Encourage Problem-Solving:** Develop problem-solving skills through interactive tasks and challenges.
- **Spark Interest in Technology:** Inspire an early interest in engineering and software development by integrating coding lessons into enjoyable gameplay.

## Game Story

In the distant future, the once-thriving city of Tunaria lies in ruins after a war between cats and robocats. Whiskers, a courageous feline leader, emerges to restore his homeland. With the city in shambles, Whiskers sets out to repair his robotic allies and rebuild Tunaria.

Armed with advanced tools and unwavering determination, Whiskers and his robocat friends work together to revive the city. Through their combined efforts, they transform Tunaria into a symbol of unity and resilience, demonstrating the power of teamwork and the strength of the feline spirit.

## Features

- **Interactive Learning Levels:** Four levels designed to teach coding basics:
  - **Tutorial / Level 1: Fur-miliar Variables** – Learn about variables by repairing and customizing robocats.
  - **Level 2: Purr-petual Loop** – Understand loops through a clicker game that involves waking up robocats.
  - **Level 3: Sequence Puurthway Maze** – Navigate Whiskers through a maze by creating logical sequences of moves.
